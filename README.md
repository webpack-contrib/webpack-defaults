# webpack-defaults

Project configuration and boilerplate defaults for webpack projects

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `webpack-defaults`:

```console

```

After install a `defaults` NPM script will be written to the local
`package.json`. To sync a project with webpack-defaults, simply run:

npm run defaults
```
